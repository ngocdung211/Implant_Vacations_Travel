# Copilot Implementation Guide: Environment Reimplementation for e-ATN-MADDPG Project

This document is a natural-language instruction contract for Copilot/Cursor. Do not generate code until you have read every section. Follow the sections in order.

## 1. Core Principles - You Must Follow These
1. **Think Before Coding**: Don't assume. Don't hide confusion. Surface tradeoffs. State assumptions explicitly. Present multiple interpretations. Push back when warranted. Stop when confused and ask for clarification.
2. **Simplicity First**: Minimum code that solves the problem. Nothing speculative. No features beyond what was asked. No abstractions for single-use code. No error handling for impossible scenarios. If 200 lines could be 50, rewrite it.
3. **Surgical Changes**: Touch only what you must. Clean up only your own mess. Don't "improve" adjacent code, comments, or formatting. Match existing style. Remove unused imports/variables/functions created by your changes.
4. **Goal-Driven Execution**: Define success criteria. Loop until verified. Transform imperative tasks into verifiable goals (e.g., 1. [Step] -> verify: [check]).
5. **Clearity**: Your code shoudl follow the Google Python Style Guide. Variable name should clear and easily to read. You should explain what you have updated to user in the chat. Not only mentioned the file but also mention the function, it's function and how it would affect
